What is Queue-Up? (QUP) 
-----------------------------

Queue-Up (QUP) is a real-time event planner. An app built for college
students, working adults, or anyone looking to meet new people and try new
things. With a few taps you can set a meet point, a time, and ping as many or as
few of your friends as you desire. None of your friends available? Join a
"queue" and attend a local event. Or make one yourself! You can do what you want, 
when you want. With minimal required planning and coordination. 


Who is Queue-Up (QUP) For?
-----------------------------

Have you ever decided to go to catch a movie, go go-karting, or checkout that new
restaurant, only to realize you had no one to go with? Then Queue-up (QUP) is
for you. A single glance at the app's dashboard is enough to see all of the
local meetup spots and ongoing events. And getting a group together is as
easy as picking a place and time.


The Competition
-----------------------------

We hear what you're thinking. Why not use Tinder or Bumble? While it's true that
these apps let you meet new people, they have focus on their user experience
around studying people's perceived looks or personality and tentatively building
relationships. Queue-Up (QUP), however is focused around real-time events and
casual meetups. No pressure. No strings attached.


The Design
