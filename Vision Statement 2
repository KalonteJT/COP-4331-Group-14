   people together by allowing you to queue up and attend events with people near you.
3. Queue Up
4. It will lead to more social interaction and new friendships for people looking to go out and make friends.
5. This is unlike Bumble Friends in that instead of swiping on a person based on their looks and personality, you meet up based on events
   you both want to attend. The plan is to also expedite the process by allowing you to queue up for events that you are trying to attend
   at the current time you are using the app.
6. The thing that makes our product different is that our event planning happens real time. There is little to no wait time in when you pair
   up with someone trying to attend the event and you guys actually attending the event.
